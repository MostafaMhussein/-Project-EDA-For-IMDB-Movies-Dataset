# -Project-EDA-For-IMDB-Movies-Dataset
The dataset is taken from the IMDB database. It contains data of 1000 most popular movies(by IMDB rating) for the period 2006-2016. IMDB (Internet Movie Database) is an online database of information related to films, television programs, home videos and video games, and internet streams, including cast, production crew and personnel biographies, plot summaries, trivia, and fan reviews and ratings.     
      
Users registered on this site are invited to rate any film on a scale of 1 to 10, and the totals are converted into a weighted mean-rating that is displayed beside each title. It also displays the Metascore of each title. Metascore is the rating given by another movie rating company called Metacritic. However, unlike IMDB, they get ratings from registered well known rating agencies and calculates a weighted average of those ratings.
